Create GitLab pipeline for .NET image to perform fortify scan.

This pipeline will primarly scan the .NET code base for the project details provided below.

--------------------------------

Background Info:

Talked with the SCA team and as best I can tell there is a way to setup the build and scan using a GitLab Pipeline.

Here is the repository for the Self-Service Portal:

Here is the details given by the SCA team.
