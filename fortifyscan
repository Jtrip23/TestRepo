The image includes the Fortify source code analyzer because the analyzer needs to have the version of .NET available that your source code uses.
The scan utilities are in /etc/fortify/bin if you want to call them directly, or you can use the convenient scan-and-report script:

# Go to your code.
cd ~/dev/my-app

# Create a folder to hold the reports/logs.
mkdir artifacts

# Mount your code at /app and tell the scan to run and publish. If you omit
# the -Publish parameter, the scan will run without publishing. If you
# specify -Verbose, you can get detailed console output.
docker run -i --rm -v ${PWD}:/app `
    fmk.nexus.onefiserv.net/fmk/dotnet/dotnet-8.0-build:FMK-20250401T173337Z `
    Start-FortifyScan.ps1 `
        -BuildId "your-build-id" `
        -Source /app `
        -Application "APMXXXXX" `
        -Version "1.0" `
        -Token "your-token-goes-here" `
        -Email "your.email@fiserv.com" `
        -OutputFolder /app/artifacts `
        -Publish

# Or, as noted, you can run the Fortify commands yourself.
docker run -i --rm -v ${PWD}:/app `
    fmk.nexus.onefiserv.net/fmk/dotnet/dotnet-8.0-build:FMK-20250401T173337Z `
    sourceanalyzer -b APMXXXXX /app
